### Introduction
As we all know that lung cancer is the one most effecting cancers throught out the world.The true cause
of cancer and its complete treatment have still not been discovered.Cancer that is caught
early enough can be treated.Early diagnosis, and treating the patients are compulsory to
reduce the risk of those lethal diseases lung disease is one of the most common diseases
that is affected in our early stage to improve the rate of patientâ€™s survival.so here we came up with this project using machine learnig alogorithm like logistic regression,Support vector Machine .we got more accuracy by using logistic regression after using k-Flod
